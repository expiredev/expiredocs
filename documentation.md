This website was created to show an example of my development as a website developer, you can copy it but make sure you put me in the credit for design and code.

Please make sure you have git and brackets installed because it will make you have a better time making this website and make sure you learn html5 and css before making edits to this site.

You can use git clone https://github.com/expiredev/expirewebsite.git, to make it appear in your allocaited folder.

Please do not copy any logos or images/svgs due to the fact you will be striked for copyright and your website will be taking down!.
